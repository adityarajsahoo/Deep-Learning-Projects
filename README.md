# Deep-Learning-Projects
This repository contains Deep learning projects with Jupyter notebook files.

1. Image Enhancement using SRGAN on DIV2K Dataset
Worked on GAN to super resolute the fine textures of the image by upscaling it.

2. Detection of Covid 19 on Chest X-ray images
Worked on a Deep learning model that can predict if the person is affected with COVID or not using Chest X-ray images.
